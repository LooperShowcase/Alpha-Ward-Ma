<p> Jude Bellingham strikes again as Real Madrid steal late victory over Celta
Real Madrid. Vinicius Jr injured for six weeks, could miss Madrid Derby
The transfer market is alive and kicking. There are only a few days left until the summer window closes but contacts between agents, intermediaries and clubs are constantly being made.

The situation at Real Madrid is significant. In his last press conference, Ancelotti said that the Real Madrid transfer window was over.

He was emphatic. However, the incoming offers for Florentino Perez to sign a striker before Friday at midnight are constant.

In addition to the usual calls, many intermediaries had already contacted Los Blancos before and after the signing of Joselu, there is the injury to Vinicius.

The Brazilian is set to be out for a minimum of six weeks, leaving Madrid's forward line severely weakened for the next two months.

Since it became known that he was injured, even without knowing the extent of the injury, the calls to offer strikers of all kinds have begun.

The offers have included players on loan, players on loan with an option to buy and even some calls proposing big money transfers.

Although the calls have multiplied, Real Madrid remain firm in their stance that their market is closed.

Florentino and Jose Angel Sanchez only made a move when Thibaut Courtois went down and reacted quickly by securing the loan signing of Chelsea's Spaniard Kepa.

With Militao's injury they sent the message that the squad would take the blow and with Vinicius out, the official response remains the same: No signings.
